# Example
A basic explanation as to how calculations are performed in a simple four-function calculator:

To perform the calculation 25 + 9, one presses keys in the following sequence on most calculators: 2 5 + 9 =.

When 2 5 is entered, it is picked up by the scanning unit; the number 25 is encoded and sent to the X register;
Next, when the + key is pressed, the "addition" instruction is also encoded and sent to the flag or the status register;
The second number 9 is encoded and sent to the X register. This "pushes" the first number out into the Y register;
When the = key is pressed, a "message" (signal) from the flag or status register tells the permanent or non-volatile memory that the operation to be done is "addition";
The numbers in the X and Y registers are then loaded into the ALU and the calculation is carried out following instructions from the permanent or non-volatile memory;
The answer, 34 is sent (shifted) back to the X register. From there, it is converted by the binary decoder unit into a decimal number (usually binary-coded decimal), and then shown on the display panel.
Other functions are usually performed using repeated additions or subtractions.
